# Cat/Non-Cat Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep neural network to classify images, specifically focusing on distinguishing between "cat" and "not-a-cat" images. The project is part of a learning assignment and leverages functions from previous assignments to construct and train the deep network.

## Project Overview

By the end of this project, the goal is to:
- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network.
- Apply the trained network to supervised learning tasks.
- Evaluate the performance of the deep network compared to simpler models like logistic regression.

## Model Architecture

### 2-layer Neural Network
This section includes the implementation of a simple 2-layer neural network. The network architecture is composed of an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer.

### L-layer Deep Neural Network
An extension of the 2-layer network into an L-layer deep network, allowing for more complex decision boundaries and improved performance.

### General Methodology
This section discusses the general approach used in building, training, and evaluating the neural networks.

## Results Analysis
After training the models, this section includes an analysis of their performance on the test set, highlighting improvements and areas of interest.

## Test with Your Own Image (Optional)
Users can extend the project by testing the model with their own images to see how well it classifies them.
